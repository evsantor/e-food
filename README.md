## Business Intelligence Analyst 
### Main Assessment



The first SQL question is ansewred in the file **Part1/part1.sql**.You can run it on BigQuery using Standard SQL.

For the second part, I first run the **Part2/breakfastClients.sql** to get the subset for the clients 
that have ordered breakfast and then I exported the data to a csv. You can also run it on BigQuery.
I have also attached two jupyter notebooks, **Part2/breakfastClientsSegmentation.ipynb** and **Part2/totalClientsSegmentation.ipynb**
for this part in case you want to run the code and their respective html files for easier viewing.

Developing was done using Python 3.7.3 and the libraries specified in the requirements.txt with their respective versions.
